**Tab Bar Controller:** The main navigation is managed using a tab bar controller, providing easy access to different sections of the app.
**View Controllers:** Each tab corresponds to a specific view controller responsible for displaying relevant content and handling user interactions.
**Data Management:** Transactions are managed and displayed using Core Manager, which handles data retrieval, updates, and deletion.
